After Ancestry.com he bought 1000Memories in 2012, Katchen developed a spreadsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios. Interest in the spreadsheet helped him inspire the idea for Wealthsimple and in 2014, he returned to Toronto to launch the company.
### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
According to Cunchbase, total funding amount is now $900.4m, which was funded with 9 rounds. In May 2014, the company initially raised CA$1.9 million from investors Eric Kirzner, Joe Canavan, and Roger Martin. In April 2015, the firm received $10 million from Power Financial Corporation in an agreement structured to allow for a future investment of $20 million within 12 months. In total, Power Financial Corporation has invested $30 million in Series A funding. It is now primarily owned by Power Corporation indirectly at 77.4%, where investments were through their holdings in Power Financial, IGM Financial, and Portag3.

Wealthsimple used latest capital to expand market position, build out product suite, and grow its team.
## Business Activities:
### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Wealthsimple offers financial tools to help investors grow and manage their money. It builds a diversified portfolio of ETFs on the investors' behalf and guides them in achieving their financial goals. The company is backed by a team of world-class financial experts. The major problem it solves is managing investments and making it easy through robo-advisory for people who are not comfortable managing funds themselves.

The company offers users the opportunity to invest their portfolio directly or have its robo-advisors allocate capital for them. Regardless of which strategy they choose, Wealthsimple charges some of the lowest management fees for allocating clients capital and growing clients wealth.
The reason it became one of the top companies in the field is due to offering zero commissions on trades. As a result, day traders can choose from a range of stocks and ETFs to buy and sell without the worry of fees eating into their profits.
### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
According to CEO Mr Katchen - traditional investment companies typically target a demographic of people aged 45 and above, but Weathsimple wants to bring people into the world of investment earlier. “Millennials are missing out on opportunities to secure their financial future,” he explained. As summarised by Katchen, the target audience is professionals between 30 and 45.

Wealthsimple now has 1.5 million clients across all products, excluding tax filers, and $15 billion in assets under administration. The company’s current focus is on improving its current product lines before adding more and improving its clients’ experience.

As disclosed by eMarketer, Canada is the slowest-growing market for robo-advisors among the three markets they cover. In 2021, they projected there will be about 360,000 users, up by 10.3% over last year. By the end of the forecast period in 2025, that number might be near 500,000.
Katchen reported that they have 72% digital advice market share in Canada, slipping slightly from the 75% they reported in 2017.  “Still huge numbers, but with only 37 million Canadians, that’s like saying you have three quarters of the market of California. Not bad, but barely a fraction of the U.S. market”.
### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Wealthsimple offers a variety of exciting products, including an online brokerage (known as Wealthsimple Invest), a hybrid bank account (known as Wealthsimple Cash), an automated tax-filing service (known as SimpleTax), and, as of recent, the introduction of a Cryptocurrency trading platform (known as Wealthsimple Crypto). The above products were the first to offer in Canada, where the company achieved competitive advantage.

Wealthsimple also has some of the most competitive fees in the robo-advisor game, with a tiered MER at 0.40% to 0.50%. The wealth management platform currently offers three tiers for investing: Basic, Black, and Generation, all of which come with a unique set of advantages and perks, including airport lounge access and healthcare benefits. Additionally, Wealthsimple offers Roundup and Overflow, two settings that grant investors more opportunities to invest.

Roundup withdraws spare change from debit purchases, rounds them up to the nearest dollar, and invests. Overflow automatically withdraws excess funds for a customer's chequing account at the investor's discretion. After the latest global shift towards sustainable investing, Wealthsimple started to offer Socially Responsible Investing (SRI), which grants investors the opportunity to fund sustainable companies. They also provide Halal Investing, which invests in options that coincide with Islamic practices.
### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Wealthsimple uses 28 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack. In addition, it is actively using 64 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and Google Font API.

According to Stackshare, company uses following for Application and Data: Java Script, React, NGINX, Java, PostgreSQL, Google Drive, Bootstrap, ES6, AngularjS, Redis, Amazon S3, Sass, Ruby, React Native, GraphQL, Redux, Amazon CloudFront,  AWS Lambda, Rails, Amazon RDS, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon SQS, Oracle, Amazon Redshift, Hibernate, Sidekiq, Jackson, Guice.

To implement the robo-advisor technology, computer algorithm is built with the steps the computer takes to create the investment portfolio. It is based on roadmap that the computer creates just specific client – after integrating their responses to a few basic questions. For example, after clients respond to questions about their age, goals, risk tolerance and current financial status, the robo-advisor computerized algorithm computes the best investment portfolio for them. The computer is taught or programmed to take clients information and integrate it with important investment research to create a portfolio with the best returns at a given time line and risk level.
## Landscape:
### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Broadly Wealthsimple identified as technical program manager, specialising in Robo-Advisors. It is a wealth management platform that directs investments using algorithms on behalf of its clients. Traditionally, there is little-to-no human monitoring of the investments, hence its name.
### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
With the first launch of a robo-advisor in 2010, the wealth management platforms has risen steadfastly in popularity over the last decade. Because robo-advisors are operating online and do not require constant monitoring, fees are lower, and prior investing knowledge isn't required.
Recent innovations are mainly based on identifying trends withing society and its demands like sustainable investing and interest in cryptocurrencies and then quickly incorporating new investment options within its offerings.

According to Fiextra, market trends for robo advising include growing digitization of financial services, a move from traditional investment services to robo-advisory, and a desire for cost-effective investment advisory. As the fintech sector keep adopting robo advisers in order to increase their income opportunities, the market is going to grow.

## Results
### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Wealthsimple aim was to disrupt Canadian banking oligopoly as younger investors look for latest technological solutions. Therefore, while robo-technology is democratizing the wealth management business in a similar way to ETFs, there are some risks, especially for those operating under the order-flow model. But Wealthsimple isn’t allowed to do so under Canadian regulations and instead it is looking to disrupt the Canadian banking oligopoly, which due to complacency and size has been slow to deploy innovative technologies. In recent years, Wealthsimple succeeded in turning financial services industry on its head with new low-cost approach to investing, which was its major impact.
### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
According to investors. it’s best to look at long-term returns eg 5 years or longer, as short-term returns don’t give you a complete picture. Since most of the companies entered the market 2-3yrs ago, shorter-term metrics was collected.
For example here is the 2.5-year annualized return data, which is net of fees and covers Dec. 31, 2017, to June 30, 2020 for global robo-advisors:
* Axos Invest - 4.38%
* SigFig - 4.71%
* Acorns – 3.49%
* Wealthsimple - 3.20%
* Wealthfront - 2.77%
* Schwab - 0.81%
* Merrill Edge - 2.83%

As can be seen, Wealthsimple performs relatively well with above average returns in the industry.
There are however, other metrics used by clients to choose preferred robo-advisor. Fees -most crucial aspect when shopping around for robo-advisors. After all, robo-advisors are supposed to undercut the higher fees that human financial advisors charge. There are 2 common fees type:

Management Expense Ratio (MER) - is a percentage attributed to expenses that come with managing a portfolio. 

Additional management fees - charged by the robo-advising service - goes to the fund manager who supervises the account and makes the decisions.

Comparative to mutual funds, robo-advisors are much more affordable, as the average MER for mutual funds typically exceeds 2%.
Other key metrics used for performance comparison includes:
*	3-Year Annualized Return
*	3-Year Above/Below Normalized Benchmark
*	3-Year Sharpe Ratio
*	Account Minimum
*	Advisory Fee
*	Weighted Average Expense Ratio
### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Since making its debut in 2014, Wealthsimple has helped to demystify investing for hundreds of thousands of regular people who want to grow their money. The company’s success thus far is unquestionable since of late February 2021, its AUM (assets under management) have been valued at $8.4 billion, and its online investment management tools have won multiple awards.

Company is performing well and keep growing its market share as it captures value was through offering lower fees. According to Wealthsimple, Canadians paid the highest investment fees out of any country in the world. While the average Canadian paid 2.5% fees for hedge funds to manage their money, Wealthsimple offered just 0.5% management fees.
In addition to this, Wealthsimple offers value-added services like portfolio rebalancing and tax loss harvesting. For people who may want to simply invest in low-cost ETFs from Vanguard (can be 0.1%) but don’t have the time to manage this themselves, this adds value and justifies the higher fees.

Overall, Wealthsimple value proposition as “better performance and more convenience for lower fees.” For young professionals who are not experienced in investing it is strong. However, for people who are confident managing their money themselves and are able to take the time to re-balance their portfolio, it likely is worth it to save the money and act alone.

There are some threats for future performance however, like ability to sustain its winning value proposition will be difficult for Wealthsimple with threats likely to come from multiple areas. First, it is possible that big banks or smaller competitors put downwards pressure on fees. However, big banks are slower, worse at technology, and would need to cannibalize their own revenue to do this. Second, competitors like Wealthfront and Betterment offer competitive services for lower fees (0.25%). Charles Schwab offers a competitive service that is free. While Canada has regulations that may make it difficult for these players to enter and succeed, and Wealthsimple may have an edge in branding and trust with Canadian young professionals, these are certainly threats to Wealthsimple. 

## Recommendations
### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Its American competitor – Acorns for example also features an FDIC-insured checking account with debit card, fractional shares, and automatic "round-ups" to invest spare change. Its low fees and fractional shares means Acorns wins out over Wealthsimple as long as client don't need a Joint or Trust account and don't need human financial advising. Acorns is unique in that it allows to invest “spare change” automatically, letting a user “round up” their purchases and invest the difference. This is great for people who have trouble saving. They can choose to apply a multiplier on these round-ups of up to 10x to consciously save and invest more. This service would be great add to Wealthsimple and will likely strengthen it market share in Canada market.

By also looking at Wealthsimple Reviews from 2021, it can be seen that few disadvantages in the service were identified. Such as lack of personal finance tools. Those seeking a fuller financial advisory experience — calculators, planning tools, educational material and a money command central — may find Wealthsimple’s streamlined website and app sparse compared with other providers. 
### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The automatic "round-ups" to invest spare change offering would be great for people who have trouble saving. They can choose to apply a multiplier on these round-ups of up to 10x to consciously save and invest more. This service would be great add to Wealthsimple and might possibly strengthen it market share in Canada market.
Offering personal finance tool, with the approach designed to merely cover the important concepts of saving and investing and keep customers apprised of what’s happening in their accounts. It’s might be ideal for savers who want to set it up and forget it, but maybe less so if they like to play with what-if retirement planning scenarios.
### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
To add personal finance tool Wealthsimple for instance, can develop something similar as Quicken software.
Quicken has been around a long time and is considered the gold standard in personal finance software. They have a suite of products that connect to multiple types of accounts, such as banks, credit cards, lenders, and investments, to aggregate user transactions.

Its services will utilize technology to track clients income, expenses, debt, property, and investments. Create a robust, 12-month budget that’s fully customizable or create users own tags to track their money however they want to. It may also adopt Syncs with its web & mobile companion apps.
### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
One technology called - CountAbout may be the budgeting tool for it. It has a feature enabling to import data from Quicken or Mint. CountAbout enables clients to download transactions from their bank and customize both income and expense categories.
